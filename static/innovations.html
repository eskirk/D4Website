                    The A5 was the first portaledge to have a frame that was made of materials so robust, it was able to support the climber as well as take extreme wear and tear from the wall.

                    The A5 was the first commercially available portaledge that could support two people.  There were a few attempts at 2-person ledge designs prior to the A5, but none lasted.

                    The “Shark Fin” is a divider system created for the two-person ledge.  It made a division between the two sides of the ledge, creating a comfortable sleeping platform for each person and a more distributed payload.

                    A5 Haulbags were the most innovative of the time, and all current haulbags "borrow" ideas from A5, including the "tuckaway" shoulder straps (an A5 first), the waterproof closure, the offset clip-in, and many other innovations.

                    The cam buckle suspension system was the first reliable adjustment system for all weather.   This system wouldn’t rip in a storm, and was easily tensionable and adjustable for the weather at hand.

                    John Middendorf adapted a technology originally coming from TeePees to make a fly which only had one sewn vertical seam.  This made leaks almost impossible, and means you only have to seal one seam!

                The fly on the A5 was the first fly on the market to be expedition ready -- it was built with doors and vents, making a comfortable base for intense adventures. A5 Portaledges enabled a huge boom in big wall standards in the 1990's because for the first time, climbers were able to withstand Himalayan type storms.

            <p align="center" class="content-bitter" style="line-height: 2; font-size: 18px;">
                When John Middendorf created the first truly stormproof Portaledge in the 1980's and 1990's, a huge boom in big wall standards arose as climbers could withstand severe storms on the world's most remote big walls for the first time.
                John sold his company in 1998 and since then, his 1990's design has become the standard for all the major Portaledge manufacturers today. In 2016, while climbing with his family, John was asked by a climber in Arapiles why no one made the nice, strong, stormproof, and lightweight ledges like A5 used to make, and the conception for D4 was born.
                In the past year, using FEA tools along with ideas that had been floating around in his head for 20 years, John has created a revolutionary design, with four major cutting-edge innovations, and sure to become the new paradigm in Portaledge technology.

                    The D4 frame has been redesigned using FEA computer tools, and uses multiple diameters of tubing to make for a stronger, lighter, and more rigid ledge.  Full Size (80” x 46.5”) yet no spreader bar is needed!  These ledges are so strong, there is literally no flex even when set up in a tree with only one point of contact.

                        The four-point suspension allows for easier adjustment and a more stable platform--the new D4 system is a 4/8-point equalising suspension with each of the four fins distributing the load to eight attachment points, creating more stability in typical off-center big wall loading situations. Weight is saved, fewer straps to tangle during set-up, and adjustments are easy for every big wall and tree bivy situation.

                    John Middendorf, the inventor of the D4 portaledge, pioneered the world's first Stormproof portaledges back in the 80's and 90's with his A5 Adventures company.  One of the solutions he came up with to make a rigid ledge back then was the "Block Corner" design, which is seen on virtually every portaledge manufactured by other companies today.  The new curved corners is a superior solution, offering more strength, lighter weight, and most importantly, increased rigidity of the overall frame.

                        The D4 portaledge is the most compact folding ledge design, and even the haul sack has been re-invented to make packing up, and most importantly, deploying the portaledge tons easier, even in high wind situations.  The  zippered haulsack enables packing up to be simple and easy, while also ensuring an organised deployment.  This unique design also allows for the portaledge to be optionally integrated with the fly (which fits in a separate pocket) as the system is packed up, for full stormproof deployments in minutes. Poised in readiness!
